# Redesigning-elbows-for-robot2

In this task, a specific design (a picture of it can be found with the files here) was provided and its elbow joint was needed to be redesigned to enhance its appearance. Instead of following the same technique used when designing the arms and joints for poppy's robot, a new method was followed. This was done with the purpose of expanding my knowledge in the cinema 4D program. 

To keep the robot's simple design, only blocks without much edits were utilized. The main focus on this task was to make the joint moveable. Three different ddesignes were made 

In Design 1 (Joint-Redesign) file: 
* The arm and forearm part were designed using cube shape with medium size holes to reduce the part's weight. 
* The joint kept as spherical shape but with hole in the middle.

In design 2 (Hinge-design) file, the purpose of it was to design a joint that can mimic the activities and shape of normal joint, hinge joint. Like in any hinges or door, this part helps keeping the object stationary. 


The following tutorial was followed for accuracy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfmddOmUko&t=231s
